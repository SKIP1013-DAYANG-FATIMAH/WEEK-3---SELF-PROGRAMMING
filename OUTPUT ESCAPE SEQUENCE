I said "Hello" to you.

Roses are red,
	Violets are blue,
Sugar is sweet,
	But I have "commitment issues",
	So I'd rather just be friends
	At this point in our relationship.

"Thank you all for coming to my home tonight," he said mysteriously.

For you love,
	Let's talk about love.
	Is it anything and everything you hoped for?
	Or the feeling haunt you?
	I know the feeling haunt you.
	This maybe the night that my dreams might let me know,
	All the stars are closer,
	All the stars are closer,
	All the stars are closer.
